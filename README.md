# ChatGPT AI Workshop Repository

## Overview

This repository contains a Python-based project demonstrating the use of OpenAI's GPT models. It includes scripts for creating and managing interactions with a GPT-powered chatbot. The project is structured into two main components:

1. **`openai_functions.py`**: This script includes functions to interact with the OpenAI API. It provides functionality to create assistants, threads, messages, and manage interactions with the GPT model.
2. **`app.py`**: This is the main executable script that uses functions from `openai_functions.py`. It orchestrates the process of creating an assistant, initiating a conversation, and handling responses.

The project is ideal for those looking to understand the practical implementation of OpenAI's GPT models in Python.
